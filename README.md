# üòä Facial Emotion Recognition using CNN (FER-2013)

This project implements a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify facial expressions into emotions using the FER-2013 dataset. It enables machines to understand human emotions visually, with potential applications in human-computer interaction, mental health analysis, and intelligent surveillance.
